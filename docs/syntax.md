# XPL Syntax Guide
XPL works like XML does but parses as code instead of storage.
To start an XPL document, use this: `<xpl></xpl>`.
You also need to add HTML for the XPL to create a website, so let's make it this:
` <xpl>
<head><title>Hi!</title></head>
<body><h1>Hi!</h1></body>
</xpl>`
Then, you may want javascript, so add this in: `<javascript>Insert JS Code Here</javascript>`
Another language by me has also been added: EAGL Online Alpha. To use it, just make a tag like this: `<EAGL>code here</EAGL>`
There is another language just for XPL: XPLScript. To use it, make a tag that says `<xplscript></xplscript>`. XPLScript uses XPL tags to run code. So far, there aren't many functions.
The current functions include value, popup, and prompt.
